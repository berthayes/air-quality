# The Hardware

## 3D Printed Case
For designing the case for this build, I took some existing designs from the folks at Adafruit and hacked away. The case is based on the [3D Printed Case for Adafruit Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/3d-printed-case-for-adafruit-feather/cad) by Ruiz Brothers with modifications for the placement of the USB cable and overall length of the case. There is a mounting bracket for the feather and case which is also based on a design by Ruiz Brothers for an [air-quality monitoring project](https://learn.adafruit.com/aqi-case) that also uses this board.

## Parts List

The IoT *thing* itself is pretty straightforward and all of the parts used for this build can be purchased online from [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com). The IoT microcontroller is an ESP32-S3 with a nifty display and the sensor is an SGP30. They talk to each other using the I2C protocol; each one has a JST SH 4-pin connector so no soldering is required if using an Adafruit STEMMA cable (or Sparkfun Qwiic cable, etc.) 

If you're going to use the 3D printed case, you'll want to create a [battery on/off switch](https://learn.adafruit.com/on-slash-off-switches). This *will* require soldering but is pretty easy.
